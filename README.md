# Fast histogram computation for data-parallel devices
We introduce the fast histogram computing algorithm for non-uniform bins that avoids
bin-search and, instead, uses iterative method for bin indices correction.
Approximate bin indices are computed using parallel map operation, which makes the
algorithm suitable for implementation for data-parallel devices. We demonstrate superior
performance of the method using uniform and log-scale map functions, but the method is
easily extensible to other maps. It is also extensible to multi-dimensional histogram
computation. Finally, we demonstrate how the same technique can be applied for generalized
discrete random number generation. Our implementation leverages oneAPI DPC++ compiler to run
the code on both CPU and GPU devices.
